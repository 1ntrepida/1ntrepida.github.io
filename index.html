                                <h3>Reaching out to the CSForAll Movement.</h3>
                                <p>After being featured in an article in the WomenWhoReign Blog, we reached out to Ruthe Farme and Jumee Song, Senior Program Managers of the movement in hopes of integrating our model nationwide. CSForAll was a program launched by the Obama administartion to help introduce computer science into school curriculums.</p>

                                <h3>EDUCodes teams up with Ctrl + She to teach high school girls how to code.</h3>
                                <p>At a local high school, EDUCodes reached out to 3 high school girls who were organizing a day long event full of activites that would teach girls in the district how to code. We held 2 workshops, how to create your own website, and a Pokemon GO themed lesson plan that teaches the participants about GPS and how to use the Google Maps API. Absolutely successful event; participants cam out of it retaining the information and were really excited that they "wrote their first lines of code."</p>

                                <h3>Setting up shop at the Long Island Maker Faire.</h3>
                                <p>Held at the local Maker Faire, we taught childen participants about the science behind LEDs and let them play bullseye with it as they threw it at a board. In the mean time, mentors did outreach to the attendees who were parents and teachers of the district, in homes of setting up meeting with local schools.</p>
